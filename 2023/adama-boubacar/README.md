Hello, I am Adama Boubacar Oumarou from Niger. I am currently studying computer science bachelor's degree at the African Leadership University Rwanda. I am passionate about data analysis, UI/UX design, and front-end development.

I am enthusiastic about applying to the Google Summer of Code program and contributing to the Wagtail CMS community. I am new to open-source contributions, but as an eager learner, and I want to challenge myself to learn new things and experience new approaches. I am excited to help to improve Wagtail CMS. It will allow me to practice my skills and learn new ones.

I look forward to learning more about Wagtail and the opportunity working with the community may offer me.

Here is my LinkedIn profile I would be happy to connect with you!
